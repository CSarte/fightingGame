This program is a Java FX java app that was developed as the final project for my Object oriented Porgramming course in the Spring of 2023. 
The program itself is a graphic user interface that allows you to create characters and fight them against each other 

To run this program you will need to have java fx set up in your IDE for the graphic user interface to run.
